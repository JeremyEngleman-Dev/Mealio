Mealio is a cooking app I am working on as a learning experience of full stack mobile development:

React Native mobile frontend
Go API layer
SQL database

Initial step is to create a feature to store and list cooking recipes. Once that is in place, I plan to work on a lab feature that will allow the user to make and save modifications to a recipe, allowing them to store multiple versions of a recipe for different uses (developing new recipes, allergy alternatives, etc)

The idea would be to have the data stored locally, allowing for usage without an internet connection, then the backend would be a way to back up the locally stored data for recovery and potentially other uses (like sharing recipes with others)
